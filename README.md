# Introduction to Node.JS

Node is one of the fastest growing platforms for building scalable web applications. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to get started using Node, its background and history, and the problems it seeks to address. You’ll also find out how asynchronous event-based development works with Node and write code together with your fellow students and teacher.

### Before You Arrive

Node.JS can run on Mac, PC and Linux operating systems. Most students bring Mac laptops and the lesson materials are presented as if working from a Mac.

To make sure we can spend as much time developing as possible, it is important that you make sure to take time to get your laptop configured.
