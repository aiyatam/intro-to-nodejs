# Introduction to Node.JS

Node is one of the fastest growing platforms for building scalable web applications. In this workshop, you will learn how to get started using Node, its background and history, and the problems it seeks to address. You will also find out how asynchronous event-based development works with Node and write code together with your fellow students and teacher.

### Before You Arrive

Node.JS can run on Mac, PC and Linux operating systems. Most students bring Mac laptops and the lesson materials are presented as if working from a Mac.

To make sure we can spend as much time developing as possible, it is important that you make sure to take time to get your laptop configured before the class. The WiFi at the GA classroom is slow and a whole classroom of students trying to update their systems brings the Internet to a halt.

* [Setup for Windows](docs/setup_windows.md)
* [Setup for Linux](docs/setup_linux.md)

If you cannot get Node installed from the instructions above, [download a binary installer](https://nodejs.org/download/) from nodejs.org. This is not the optimal way for Node to be installed on your system, but would allow you to follow along with most of the examples. If you are having problems plan to arrive at least 15 minutes early and let me know and we will try to resolve your problems.

### Do I Have to Know JavaScript?

You do not have to have ever written a line of JavaScript to benefit from this course. Each lesson has a workspace for you to write and test code and working examples you can run from simple commands in your Terminal. Node.JS is built to scale and the amount of code to build complex services can be surprisingly concise.

Node.JS is JavaScript. If you have worked with JavaScript and/or jQuery in the browser, you already have the fundamentals to begin building powerful applications in Node.

### Suggested Reading

Whether you are a JS newbie or a seasoned ninja, a great article to review is ["A Re-introduction to JavaScript"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) on the Mozilla Developer Network. This article is a straight-forward walkthrough of the fundamentals principles of JavaScript.

If you want a deep crash course in JavaScript, Code Academy's [10-hour JavaScript course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) followed by their [3-hour jQuery course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery) would be the best place to start. Again, not required.

### Deploy Your Web Apps (optional)

You will have the opportunity to deploy simple Web apps live on DigitalOcean hosting on a domain purchased from Namecheap.com. If interested, students should complete the following 24 hours before class:

* [Register a domain at Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)
* [Apply for access to Namecheap's API access](https://manage.www.namecheap.com/myaccount/modify-profile-api.asp?APIACCESS.x=1&rkey=NC)
* [Register for a Digital Ocean account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new)
