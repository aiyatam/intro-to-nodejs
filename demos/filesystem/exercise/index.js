// Challenge: Write a program that reads the file sonnets.tx
// in this directory. The file contains Shakspeare's 154 sonnets
// seperated by the characters ---. Your program should seperate the
// the sonnets into individual files and save them by number in the
// output directory. Use at .txt file extention with the name.

// Use the Filesystem module: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html

// BONUS POINTS: Use the roman-numerals package from npm
// to convert each file name to roman numerals. The package is
// already installed in node_modules. You can view the
// documentation here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/roman-numerals

// HINT: In JS you can reference a linebreak with "\t"
// so "some text\t" is the line "some text" followed by a linebreak
