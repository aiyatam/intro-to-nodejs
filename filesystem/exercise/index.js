// Challenge: Write a program that reads the file sonnets.tx
// in this directory. The file contains Shakspeare's 154 sonnets
// seperated by the characters ---. Your program should seperate the
// the sonnets into individual files and save them by number in the
// output directory.

// Use the Filesystem module: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html

// HINT: In JS you can reference a linebreak with "\t"
// so "some text\t" is the line "some text" followed by a linebreak
